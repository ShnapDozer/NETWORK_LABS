== How to run MaraDNS in Cygwin ==

I have made sure MaraDNS can compile and run in Cygwin.  While a
maradns.exe is provided for users of the older maradns.exe binary
(and it has been updated to be Y2038 compliant), Windows users
are better off running a Cygwin compile of MaraDNS.

To compile and run MaraDNS:

* Go to https://cygwin.com/ and download and install Cygwin
* When installing Cygwin, be sure to install both "gcc" and "make"
  (There is also a make implementation which can compile MaraDNS,
   maramake, in the Docker-stuff/ folder)
* Get the source code for MaraDNS
* From the MaraDNS-3.5.{version} directory, where {version} is the number
  0005 or higher, type in the following commands from the Cygwin command
  prompt:

	./configure ; make ; make install
	cygrunsrv.exe --install MaraDNS --path /usr/local/bin/maradns.exe
	cygrunsrv.exe -S MaraDNS

* MaraDNS now runs as a service.  One may edit /etc/mararc (e.g.
  C:\Cygwin64\etc\mararc as seen from Windows) and the files in
  /etc/maradns to add or remove zones from MaraDNS.

Note that Deadwood remains a native Windows service, and there are no
plans to change that.  This change affects *only* the native build
of MaraDNS (which, unlike Deadwood, was never made a proper Windows
service, and had Y2038 issues until MaraDNS 3.5.0028).
